        Hello, I'm Vineetha Kondepudi, a dedicated software developer currently working at Miracle Software Systems in Vijayanagaram. I graduated with a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) from VSM College of Engineering, Ramachandrapuram, where I also completed my Diploma in EEE. My academic journey began at ZPH Schools, where I completed my 10th grade with a GPA of 8.3.

        Originally from Vendra, my family has always been supportive of my career aspirations. My father is a farmer, my mother is a homemaker, and my younger brother has completed his degree as well. My educational background has provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles, which I apply to my work in software development.

      <p className="bio-text">
        I am passionate about technology and continuously seek to expand my skills and knowledge. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, gardening, listening to music, and crafting. These hobbies help me unwind and inspire creativity in both my personal and professional life.
